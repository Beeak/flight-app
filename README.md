[Estonian](https://github.com/Beeak/flight-app/blob/main/README-ee.md)**


An app made for tracking and collecting planes around you. 
The idea for the app came from my long time wish to see planes flying around you in a fixed radius.
Data is coming from the public [airplanes.live API](https://airplanes.live/api-guide/).
