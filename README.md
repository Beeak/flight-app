An app made for tracking and collecting planes around you. 
The idea for the app came from my long time wish to see planes flying around you in a fixed radius.
Data is coming from the public [airplanes.live API](https://airplanes.live/api-guide/).

#### Planned technologies

Front - React-native (plan is to get it uploaded to the Play store for AdSense $$$)

Backend - Laravel


## Main planned features

1. Notification Alerts

  1.1 Real-time alerts about planes within the set radius
  1.2 Include details like flight number, airline, departure and arrival cities
  1.3 Customizable notification settings (e.g., time of day, specific airlines)

2. Plane Collection

  2.1 Digital logbook to ‘collect’ planes
  2.2 Users can add photos, notes, and tags to each plane
  2.3 Categories and filters (e.g., by airline, type, flight path)
  2.4 Achievements and badges for certain milestones (e.g., 50 different airlines)

3. Leaderboards

  3.1 Global and friend-specific leaderboards
  3.2 Points system for collecting planes, rare finds, and activity
  3.3 Monthly and overall rankings with rewards for top collectors
