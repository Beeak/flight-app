An app made for tracking and collecting planes around you. 
The idea for the app came from my long time wish to see planes flying around you in a fixed radius.
Data is coming from the public [airplanes.live API](https://airplanes.live/api-guide/).


### Main planned features

1. Notification Alerts

Real-time alerts about planes within the set radius

Include details like flight number, airline, departure and arrival cities

Customizable notification settings (e.g., time of day, specific airlines)

2. Plane Collection

Digital logbook to ‘collect’ planes

Users can add photos, notes, and tags to each plane

Categories and filters (e.g., by airline, type, flight path)

Achievements and badges for certain milestones (e.g., 50 different airlines)

3. Leaderboards

Global and friend-specific leaderboards

Points system for collecting planes, rare finds, and activity

Monthly and overall rankings with rewards for top collectors
